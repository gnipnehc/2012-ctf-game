The customer, a puggle breeder, suspects that the user authentication needs more locking down, but knows little else.  You have been given nothing but a web URL. Visit the [server](http://$htaccess) to see where the user logs in. You should be able to break in and view the flag. Please, think of the puggles.</td>

After a series of privacy problems at Facebook, MySpace has seen an opportunity to win their users back with some great new features.

    <td>Scientists have determined the Great A'Tuin's gender at long last, unfortunately they put it inside the [Discworld Planetary Information System](http://$turtles) and then had a rather unfortunate meeting with Death. Sadly, the late scientists were pretty bad at web sites and budget cuts had meant that they had to make their own information system. Even worse, though they were smart they were, as so many scientists are, a little mad (and really bad at web design, if we hadn't mentioned it). We honestly have no idea what they were even trying to do with their system. Maybe you'll have better luck than we did.
