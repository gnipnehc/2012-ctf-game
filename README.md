    <td>You have been asked to perform a penetration test on a web site that was a prototype and is now being used in production. The customer, a puggle breeder, suspects that the user authentication needs more locking down, but knows little else.  You have been given nothing but a web URL. Visit the [server](http://$htaccess) to see where the user logs in. You should be able to break in and view the flag. Please, think of the puggles.</td>

    <td>MySpace is feeling a bit left out after everyone moved their social circles to Facebook (see what I did there?). After a series of privacy problems at Facebook, MySpace has seen an opportunity to win their users back with some great new features. We caught them testing a new [chat service](http://$nodejs:3000) but it doesn't seem to be much better than any of their other web properties. At least you can't change the background...oh the humanity.</td>

    <td>Scientists have determined the Great A'Tuin's gender at long last, unfortunately they put it inside the [Discworld Planetary Information System](http://$turtles) and then had a rather unfortunate meeting with Death. Sadly, the late scientists were pretty bad at web sites and budget cuts had meant that they had to make their own information system. Even worse, though they were smart they were, as so many scientists are, a little mad (and really bad at web design, if we hadn't mentioned it). We honestly have no idea what they were even trying to do with their system. Maybe you'll have better luck than we did.

You've been dying for that new Macbook Pro with Retina display and need some fast cash so a few other students have paid you to change their AP Calculus grades. This can only be done through an admin account.</td>

Unfortunately, before he was able to upload it to our server he dropped his computer and the hard drive died. Luckily we were able to recover most of the data but the video seems to be corrupted. We really don't want to redo this video so if it is recoverable that'd be great.

We do not believe this was a suicide, unfortunately he is in no state to tell us and all of the security cameras in his office seem to be broken. Luckily he left us a service running at $server that is listening on the port of the current year. We tried talking to it but our guys are at a loss.</td>
